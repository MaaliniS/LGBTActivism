<h3 class = "header, h3"> What are some issues that LGBTQ+ youth face? </h3>
<p class = "header">The disparities in both mental and physical health that are seen between LGBTQ+ and non LGBTQ+ youth are influenced largely by their experiences of stigma and discrimination during the development of their sexual orientation and gender identity. These negative experiences include high rates of physical and emotional bias and violence; rejection by families and peers; and inadequate supports in schools, employment, and communities because of their sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. </p>
